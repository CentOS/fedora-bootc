# fedora-bootc

Create and maintain base *bootable* container images from Fedora ELN package.

## Motivation

The original Docker container model of using "layers" to model
applications has been extremely successful.  This project
aims to apply the same technique for bootable host systems - using
standard OCI/Docker containers as a transport and delivery format
for base operating system updates.
